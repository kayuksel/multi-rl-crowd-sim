Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning of Crowd Simulation in GPU (PyTorch)  
Also, developing Predator-Prey Behaviours and a Battlefield Simulation!

Check the following videos for behaviour learnt by each simulation type:

**gym_hunt.py** Gym environment for Predator-Prey Behaviours (in-progress)

**Ranged army self-play on a battlefield with obstacles is also in-progress!**

Note: This is like a Sniper army battle where they can hide behind each other.  
The strength of hitting also reduces as their health decrease by the attacks.
